## Authenticate with Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection API
Assuming you have [configured the sample site](./Configure&#32;the&#32;sample&#32;site.md), it will automatically acquire API tokens to use to call Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection APIs.

The [token provider service](../src/Infrastructure/Services/TokenProviderService.cs) acquires tokens using MSAL in C#. It generates an HTTP request and receives a response like below in the case of authenticating with a secret:

### Request
```http
POST <authority>/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1

Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: <content length>
Host: login.microsoftonline.com

client_id=<Azure Active Directory client app ID>
&client_info=1
&client_secret=<Azure Active Directory client app secret>
&scope=https://api.dfp.microsoft.com/.default
&grant_type=client_credentials
```

### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: <date>
Content-Length: <content length>

{
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":"3599",
  "ext_expires_in":"3599",
  "access_token":"<your access token; e.g.: eyJ0eXA...NFLCQ>"
}
```

## Token refreshing
Ensure your application gets a new access token as needed. For instance, when your existing one is about to expire. Many frameworks, including .NET Core seen in the C# sample above, handle this for you automatically by caching your access token and only getting a new one as needed.

## Send events to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection
As an example, all Purchase Protection related events sent to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection follow the same JSON model:
```
{
    "property 1": <value 1>,
    "property 2": <value 2>,
    ...
    "_metadata": {
      "trackingId": "<tracking ID>",
      "merchantTimeStamp": "<event date in ISO 8601 format>"
   }
}
```

The event data model varies from one event type to the next, but all have a _metadata property.

For example, see the following request and response when sending a refund event to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.

### Request

```http
POST <Merchant API Endpoint>/v1.0/MerchantServices/events/Refund HTTP/1.1
Host: <Merchant API Endpoint>

  "purchaseId": "<purchase ID>",
  "_metadata": {
    "trackingId": "<tracking ID>",
    "merchantTimeStamp": "<event date in ISO 8601 format>"
  }
}
```
### Response
