# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection - API examples
## Account sign up (Purchase Protection APIs) - Approved and rejected sign up flows

After sending Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection a sign up event, it is up to you to use the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection risk score to either continue with or stop your sign up workflow. Inform Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection of the final sign up status to improve Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection models.

**Important:** Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection does not yet support rules for sign up assessment like it does for purchase assessment. Implement rules in your application to handle the sign up response risk score. For instance, you may decide that any score higher than some threshold is too risky and you will reject those sign ups. Once Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection supports sign up rules, configure those rules directly in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection so that your applications can simply honor the merchant rule decision in the sign up response. This sample site randomly rejects 1 out of 3 sign ups to demonstrate the concept.

## Sign up flow
The sign up event flow consists of:
1. Sign up event
1. Sign up status event

**NOTES**
- You are not required to send these events, much less send them in any particular order, or within any specific time. The sample site does, in fact, follow this order. 
- As the merchant, you decide when to call the SignUp API. It may be before or after you have created an account in your database. The sample site calls the SignUp API before it creates a user in its database and only creates the user in the database if it decides to approve the sign up. Notice how this sample site does not send a user ID until the sign up status event, and even then, only when it decides to approve the user. This implementation decision is guided by the sample site's behavior.
- Set the 'assessmentType' field based on if you plan to use the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection risk score:
  - Pass 'Evaluate' if you do NOT plan to use the risk score and are still evaluating Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection against your existing fraud solution.
  - Pass 'Protect' if you plan to use the risk score . This creates more accurate reports when we can distinguish between your 'Evaluate' and 'Protect' API calls.
- In the sample site, an existing user's ID is set to their email address which is also tied to how they log in to the sample site. Furthermore, the sample site ensures that no two customers have the same email address. This ensures user IDs will be unique for the sample site, as well as unique when sent to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. Decide what format to use for existing user IDs. It does not have to be an email address, but you should be careful not to duplicate user IDs.

```

## Rejected sign up status event
